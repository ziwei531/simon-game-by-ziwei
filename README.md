Simon Game Made with Jquery

This is a project that was made back in 2021. I utilized jQuery and for the first time created a website project that truly challenged my knowledge in regards of handling the DOM for the purpose of creating an interactive game, namely the Simon Game. Game's website link is available [here](https://ziwei531.github.io/simon-game-by-ziwei/)

Simon Game is an electronic game of memory skill. The game has a circular design with 4 big illuminated buttons: red, green, blue and yellow.  Each button is linked to an electronic sound which will help the player to memorize the series of illuminated buttons. 

To play the Simon game:
1.  Press any key to start the game
2.  Simon will give you a signal by illuminating one of its buttons and playing a sound
3.  Repeat the signal by pressing the same color button
4.  Simon will duplicate its first signal and add one more
5.  Repeat these signals by pressing their corresponding buttons in order. 
6.  Continue playing as Simon adds more signals. 
7. If you failed to press all the buttons in order, the screen will flash red and an auditorial feedback will play. 
8. The game gets progressively harder as you advance to higher levels!

## Note
If no sounds are playing, it might be that your browser is disallowing audio from being played, ensure you give the necessary permissions. There were also instances wherein extension(s) might be interfering with the sounds from being played. If sounds still don't play, please kindly use another browser to play the game.
